Analysis

* In general temperatures are warmer nearer the equator, but some of the warmest temperatures occur just below the equator at about -20 Deg. Latitude.

* There is no strong relationship between latitude and humidity, and most cities have between 80-100% humidity. Interestingly, while the equator has high humidity (about 70-100%), several cities just beyond it at 20 Deg. Latitude and -20 Deg. Latitude have some of the lowest recorded humidity (about 10-30%).

* Although there is no strong relationship between latitude and wind speed, and most cities across latitudes have about 0-15mph speeds, many of the higher wind speeds tend to occur further from the equator.
